Self-Driving for Gta Sa using CNN:

- **Model:** fine - tuned EfficientNet B1 on a small Custom Dataset

- You can find dataset and how to capture data from this [greate Repo](https://github.com/yogendra-yatnalkar/Self_driving_Car_for_GTA-San-Andreas.git).

- This model was trained from the dataset above with my own small dataset. 

- More data will improve model performance.
